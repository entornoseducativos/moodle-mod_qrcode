This activity plugin was created using this templage: https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-mod_newmodule

Currently, GradeQR is a plugin, an App, and an idea. The idea is to allow teachers to grade assignments by scanning a QR code. Generally I use this technique to make grading assignments during class go more quickly, but there are many applications. For example, students could copy and paste the QR codes into their assignments.

Currently, the plugin is a very simple activity plugin that encodes the server's url, the course id, the activity id, the student id, and the maximum grade for the assignment into a QR code. Upon scanning the QR code, an app submits a grade to the server using Moodle's web service capability. To communicate with the server, the administrator does need to provide users of the app with a token.

While the plugin is functional, I am fairly certain it is in need of improvement as this is my first plugin and I'm not sure of the best way to go about adding code. The 2nd to last line in view.php is where the QR code is generated and displayed. Currently it's just an echo command. I don't know how to use Moodle's $OUTPUT system to add code to the body of a document. Again, any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

While this plugin serves my purposes, it would be better if this concept were integrated into the assign activity plugin as a submission plugin. I foresee wanting to use the same Moodle course with other teachers who would like to grade their students using a more conventional submission type while I scan QR codes. I attempted to make this modification to the assign activity plugin myself, but I was unsure how to go about passing the url to the parent plugin (the assign module). Also, I found that adding the QR code submission plugin interfered with the placement of the Online text label and checkbox in the assignment creation menu. Again, any help would be greatly appreciated.
